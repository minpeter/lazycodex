# codex-ultrawork

Codex plugin that injects a compact orchestration directive (the **ultrawork** prompt) when the user prompt contains `ultrawork` or `ulw` (word-bounded, case-insensitive).

Bundled Codex agent role TOMLs in `agents/` are installed into `CODEX_HOME/agents/` by the omo-codex installer (`linkCachedPluginAgents`, in `src/cli/install-codex/link-cached-plugin-agents.ts`). Install-time linking uses symlinks on Linux / macOS and file copies on Windows. There is no Python `SessionStart` hook anymore.

## What the injected directive enforces

| Mandate | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Goal + binding success criteria | Call `create_goal` (or open with a `# Goal` block) listing the deliverable + **3+ realistic QA scenarios** (happy path, edge cases, adjacent-surface regression). Each scenario MUST name which **Manual-QA channel** it will use. "Tests pass" is supporting signal, NEVER completion proof. |
| Manual-QA channels (TESTS ALONE NEVER PROVE DONE) | A dedicated top-level section enumerates the **four** channels you can use to verify a criterion in reality: **(1) HTTP call** (`curl -i` / Playwright APIRequestContext), **(2) tmux** (`tmux new-session` + `send-keys` + `capture-pane`), **(3) Browser use** (Playwright / puppeteer / Chromium driving the real page), **(4) Computer use** (OS-level GUI automation against the running app). Every criterion picks one channel, builds a real-usage scenario, runs it, and captures the artifact — every time. Aux surfaces (CLI stdout / DB diff / parsed config) only count for genuinely CLI- or data-shaped criteria. |
| Surface + paired cleanup | Execution loop step 4 (**SURFACE-AS-SCENARIO**) runs the chosen channel scenario end-to-end. Step 5 (**CLEANUP, PAIRED**) tears down every QA-spawned process / tmux session / browser context / container / port / temp dir, with a one-line receipt appended to the notepad. Leftover state → NOT done. |
| Durable /tmp notepad | `mktemp -t ulw-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).XXXXXX.md` with sections `Plan`, `Success criteria + QA scenarios`, `Now`, `Todo`, `Findings`, `Learnings`. **Append**, never rewrite. |
| Obsessive atomic todos | Every action — even one-line edits, `ls`, single test runs — becomes a todo. Format: `path: <action> for <criterion> — verify by <check>`. One in_progress at a time, mark completed immediately. |
| GPT-5.2 xhigh verification gate | Triggered automatically on user-requested rigor, 3+ files, 20+ turns, 30+ minutes, or refactor/migration/perf/security work. Use the bundled `codex-ultrawork-reviewer` agent role when available. Reviewer verdict is **binding** — no "false positive", no minimising, no arguing. Loop until **unconditional** approval. "Looks good but…" = REJECTION. |

The directive is currently 11,005 chars / 232 lines and follows the GPT-5.5 prompting structure (Role / Goal / Manual-QA channels / Bootstrap / Execution loop / Verification gate / Commits / Constraints / Output / Stop rules).

## Install (via this marketplace)

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai install
```

The installer copies the plugin into `~/.codex/plugins/cache/sisyphuslabs/omo/0.1.0`, registers the `sisyphuslabs` marketplace from the `lazycodex` Git repository, enables `omo@sisyphuslabs` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, registers the `UserPromptSubmit` hook, and installs the bundled agent TOMLs into `~/.codex/agents/` (symlinks on Unix, copies on Windows). A manifest at `<plugin-cache>/.installed-agents.json` records the installed paths for clean uninstall.

## How it works

`hooks/hooks.json` registers a `UserPromptSubmit` hook running:

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/ultrawork-detector.py
```

Codex passes the prompt payload on stdin. When the pattern `\b(?:ultrawork|ulw)\b` (case-insensitive) matches, the hook writes the directive to stdout — Codex injects non-JSON stdout as `additional_context` for the next turn. Otherwise the hook writes nothing and exits 0. Malformed input also exits 0 to never block the turn.

Bundled agent role TOMLs in `agents/` ship to `CODEX_HOME/agents/` at install time, not via a runtime hook. The installer creates a symlink on Linux / macOS (so the cache directory is the single source of truth and removal of the cache cleanly breaks the link) and a file copy on Windows (because symlinks require admin privileges or Developer Mode). Both code paths overwrite stale files and write a `.installed-agents.json` manifest under the plugin cache for clean uninstall tracking.

## Smoke test

```bash
PAYLOAD='{"cwd":"/tmp","hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","model":"gpt-5.5","permission_mode":"default","session_id":"x","transcript_path":"","turn_id":"y","prompt":"please ultrawork"}'
echo "$PAYLOAD" | python3 hooks/ultrawork-detector.py | head -3
```

Expect `<ultrawork-mode>` ... directive body.

## Agent role smoke test

Run `npx --yes --package oh-my-openagent omo install --platform=codex`, then inspect `~/.codex/agents/`. On Linux / macOS you should see symlinks; on Windows you should see file copies. Each TOML should declare a non-empty `name`, `description`, and `developer_instructions`.

## Privacy

This plugin only reads local hook payloads and emits the bundled directive text on keyword match. Bundled agent TOML files ship to `CODEX_HOME/agents/` at install time. No network calls and no telemetry from this component.
